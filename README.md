# Setting up scouting database in codespaces

### 1. Open and prepare codespaces

Press , on your keyboard to open codespaces. If you don't already have a codespaces that your working on, press create new codespace.

### 2. Prepare and open the app/code

Make sure you are in TERMINAL, if you are, the first thing you see should be /workspaces/ScoutingDatabase2025 (*your branch*) $. 
Just after this line type, npm install. 
```bash
/workspaces/ScoutingDatabase2025 (*your branch*) $ npm install
```
After it finishes loading type, cd client.
```bash
/workspaces/ScoutingDatabase2025 (*your branch*) $ cd client
```
In the line that pulls up, type npm install.
```bash
/workspaces/ScoutingDatabase2025/client (*your branch*) $ npm install
```
Next type cd .. this gets you back to the main terminal, insted of the client one. 
```bash
/workspaces/ScoutingDatabase2025/client (*your branch*) $ cd .. 
```
Repeat this process for server.
```bash
/workspaces/ScoutingDatabase2025 (*your branch*) $ cd server
/workspaces/ScoutingDatabase2025/server (*your branch*) $ npm install
-
/workspaces/ScoutingDatabase2025/server (*your branch*) $ cd ..
```
finally, type npm start to start the program.
```bash
/workspaces/ScoutingDatabase2025 (*your branch*) $ npm start
```
Congrats, you just set up the website, from here, it should open a seperate tab with the frontend dispaly on it.

### 3. Insure the website is updating corectly.

go to PORTS and look a visibiliy, change the visiblity for 3001 to Public.

While you're in PORTS, copy the url for 3001 by holding your mouse over it and clicking the first icon. 

On the sidebar, open client > src > components > Home.js

Use // to edit out the localhost url and deleate the // over the url below it.

In the lower url paste your copyed url up to the slash and type api/v1 between the two slashes that show up.
```bash
//axios.get('http://localhost:3001/events')
axios.get('[*copyed url*]/api/v1/users')
```
Example:
```bash
//axios.get('http://localhost:3001/events')
axios.get('https://fuzzy-telegram-5ggxpqj4xjw5c4q56-3001.app.github.dev/api/v1/users')
```

### 4. Insure you have the proper extentions installed
Click Extentions on the farthest sidebar and look up rest client

Install rest client.

## This may not work at all while at school, insted use a strategy laptop or home computer


## setting up in VS code
setting up in vs code much like setting up in codespaces.

### 1. Insure you have all the correct programs installed. 
before you even begain to open the code, make sure you have the following programs installed:
1. VS code
2. Github desktop
3. Git
4. Node js 
5. DB browser
### 2. Getting your code on VS
In order to get your github code onto VS you will first need to open github on your browser and go to your branch. 

After you get to your branch, you should see a big green button labeled <> code, press this. A drop down menu will open, on it, click Open with github desktop.

In the github desktop menu, look for a button that says open with VS code. if you do not see such a button, you can go to Repository > open in Visual Studio Code.

After the VS code loads, you will need to open a termial if one is not open already, to do this go to the top left and  press Terminal > New Terminal. 

In the termial, you will get out of powershell and into the command menu using 
the command cmd.
```bash
PS C:\*your branch*\ScoutingDatabase2025> cmd
```
Afterwords, you will enter the commands from instructions 2-4 in Setting up scouting database in codespces (see above). Stuff
